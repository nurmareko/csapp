Assume the two register writes in the write-back stage for popq occur in 
the order listed in Figure 4.20. What would be the effect of executing 
popq %rsp?

  it will first use ValE as the new value of %rsp and pop the value
  stored at the previous value of %rsp into %rsp, ultimately performing
  the same effect as mrmovq (%rsp), %rsp.

Does this conform to the desired behaviour for Y86-64, as determined in
Problem 4.8?

 Yes.
