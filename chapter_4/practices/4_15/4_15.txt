What would be the effect of the instruction pushq %rsp according to the
steps listed in Figure 4.20?

  First the original value of %rsp will be pushed to the stack, then the
  value of %rsp will be updated

Does this conform to the desired behaviour for Y86-64, as determined in
Problem 4.7?

  Yes
