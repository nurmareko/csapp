Where should two registers be inserted to maximize the throughput of a 
three-stage pipeline? 

stage 1			stage 2			stage 3
80+30+20 = 130ps	60+50+20 = 130ps	70+10+20 = 100ps

  the register should be inserted after B and D logic.

========================================================================
What would be the throughput and latency?

  throughput â‰ˆ 7.69 GIPS

  latency (130 * 3) ps = 390 ps
