What is the minimum number of stages that would yield a design with the 
maximum achievable throughput? Describe this design, its throughput, and
its latency.
========================================================================

  A -> reg -> B -> reg -> C -> reg -> D -> reg -> EF -> reg

  clock cycle every 100 ps

  throughput â‰ˆ 10.00 GIPS

  latency = (100 * 5) ps = 500 ps
