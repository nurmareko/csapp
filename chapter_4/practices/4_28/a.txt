Inserting a single register gives a two-stage pipeline. Where should the
register be inserted to maximize throughput?

  we can have 5 different arrangement for two-stage pipeline

	stage 1				stage 2
  A	(80+20) ps = 100 ps		(30+60+50+70+10+20) ps = 240 ps
	
  B	(80+30+20) ps = 130 ps		(60+50+70+10+20) ps = 210 ps

  C	(80+30+60+20) ps = 190 ps	(50+70+10+20) ps = 150 ps

  D	(80+30+60+50+20) ps = 240 ps	(70+10+20) ps = 100 ps

  E	(80+30+60+50+70+20) ps = 310 ps	(10+20) ps = 30 ps

  to maximize throughput we want arrangement that have smallest
  difference between stage 1 and stage 2.
  
  the register should be inserted after the combinational logic C.

========================================================================
What would be the throughput and latency?

  throughput â‰ˆ 5.26 GIPS

  latency = 190 ps * 2 = 380 ps
