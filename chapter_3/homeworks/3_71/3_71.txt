========================================================================
good_echo criteria
  - reads a line from standard input and writes it to standard output
  - should work for an input line of arbitrary length
  - may use the library function fgets
  - make sure your function works correctly even when the input lines
    requires more space than you have allocated for your buffer
  - check for error conditions and return when one is encountered

========================================================================
how echo from the text book fail good_echo criteria?
  when the input length is greater than the allocated buffer the
  function may raise an error.

how can we fix this?
  we can make so the function only store up to buffer size including
  terminating character and ignore the rest.
