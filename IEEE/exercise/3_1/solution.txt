(a) With sign and modulus system one of the 32 bits is reserve for 
    representing the sign, and the number zero have two representation
    that is positive zero and negative zero, let say the two zero are
    equal, using this system we can represent:

    zero and positive	zero and negative	unique integer
    2^31		2^31			2^32 - 1

(b) With 2's complement every bits pattern is unique therefore it can
    represent 2^32 unique integer

For which of these two systems is the representation for zero unique?
 The 2's complement have unique representation of zero, as for sign
 and modulus have 2 way to represent zero.
