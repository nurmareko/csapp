A. the expression will yields 0 when:
   - x is TMIN, and y is any value other than TMIN
   - x is positive number, and y is TMIN

B. the expression always yields 0 because:
   ((x + y) << 4) + y - x == ((x + y) * 16) + y - x
                          == (16x + 16y) + y - x
			  == 16x - x + 16y + y
			  == 15x + 17y

C. the expression always yields 0 because:
   ~x + ~y + 1 == ~x - y
	       == -x - 1 - y
	       == -(x + y) - 1
	       == ~(x + y)

D. the expression always yileds 0 because the expression on the right
   hand side will implicitly cast to unsgined value, and because the
   the bit pattern of ux-uy and x-y is the same.

E. the expression always yields 0 because when the two right most bits
   of x is not [00] we will get value between (x-3) to (x-1), or when 
   the two right most bits of x is [00] we get x back as the final value.
